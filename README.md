### GruntLauncher ###

A simple add-on for Visual Studio that adds options for launching Grunt commands directly from the Solution Explorer contextual menu when right-clicking over a Gruntfile.

Long running processes like 'grunt watch' continue to run in the background and can be killed by selecting them again when checked

#### Attention

To work well this plugin needs a recent version of node.js installed on yout system due to a bug where output is not correclty redirected. If you don't see grunt output try to update node.js.
